            On January 4, 2025, we launched the first-ever Alpha Test for SoPets, inviting our earliest supporters to try out the platform. This phase was a massive learning experience, and as it comes to an end, we're excited to share what we've learned and how it's shaping the next version of SoPets.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-12 text-2xl font-bold text-white">What We Tested</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            The Alpha Test focused on cross-platform functionality, allowing SoPets to move between devices. However, we quickly learned that setting this up was too tedious for most testers, making it difficult for them to experience the feature as intended.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            We also introduced Tap to Deploy, a way to manually send your SoPet between devices. While innovative, it didn't align with the seamless experience we envisioned. This led us to create the Presence System, which will be a game-changerâ€”stay tuned for more details!
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-12 text-2xl font-bold text-white">Key Insights</h2>
          <br></br>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-4 pl-6 text-gray-300">
            <li><strong className="text-white">Feature Expectations:</strong> Many users expected more of a game-like experience, especially since they primarily used SoPets on mobile. However, our focus was on a desktop companion.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">User Friction:</strong> Cross-platform functionality had too many setup steps, leading us to rethink how SoPets should travel between devices.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Refining Our Vision:</strong> We realized that at its core, SoPets is a 24/7 digital companionâ€”not just a game. The next beta test will focus on companionship on desktop to bring that vision to life.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="mt-12 text-2xl font-bold text-white">What's Next?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            We've learned a lot from this Alpha Test, and it's helped shape our vision for the future of SoPets. Want to know what's coming next?
